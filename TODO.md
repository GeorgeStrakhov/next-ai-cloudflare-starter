##  FIXES:

- all design should be using things like foreground / backgound / accent etc and typefaces too centrally defined, so that design update is really just globals css
- should be easy to test setup.sh things without actually installing things.

## LATER IMPROVEMENTS:

- add logging and alerting (investigate best setup on cloudflare)
- /contact page
- add user account with profile pic etc
- add admin interface (seeded with admin email on setup.sh)
- add ability to restrict sign-in to only whitelisted emails or domains.
- add waitlist feature
- add TTS and STT services
- add optional orgs on top of users
- social sign-in?
