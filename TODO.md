##  FIXES:

- all design should be using things like foreground / backgound / accent etc and typefaces too centrally defined, so that design update is really just globals css

## LATER IMPROVEMENTS:

- add logging and alerting (investigate best setup on cloudflare)
- /contact page
- add ability to restrict sign-in to only whitelisted emails or domains.
- add waitlist and invites
- add TTS and STT services
- add optional orgs on top of users
- social sign-in?
